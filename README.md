# SimpleEmailAuthenticationViaSendgrid
This is a simple email authentication full stack project that authenticates an email via sendgrid, and then logs the email it in google sheets if valid.
No changes to be done in frontend.
Backend needs a few changes before working.
1. Create an account on SendGrid. Verify yourself as a sender. Then generate an API KEY for sending messages only.
2. Use that API in Backend where required.
3. Use your gmail account to create a google sheets API service on console.google.com.
4. create your google sheets, and copy it's ID. Paste it in the backend wherever required.
6. Use the credentials.json file to get access to your google sheets.
7. The backend is properly commented, so things are self explanatory.
